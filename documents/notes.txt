Electrical;-

 The ESP32 pin 2 (3V3 OUT) is 3.25/3.26 V.

 The ESP32 pin 30 (Frog1 J) is 3.25 V when inactive and 0.00 V when active.
 
 The LED in the TLP241 has a forward voltage drop of between 1.1 V and 1.4 V (typical is 1.27 V)
  at a forward current of 10 mA.

 Using a value of 220R for the series resistor gives an LED current of between 9.77 mA and 8.41 mA.

 The LED has a recommended operating current of 7.5 mA, with a maximum of 19.5 mA.
  Absolute maximum is 30 mA.
 
 The GPIOs on the Arduino Nano ESP32 can handle source currents up to 40 mA, and sink currents up to 28 mA.
